### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: The science of happiness
+ This project is conducted by [fangqi ouyang]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] The happiness becomes one of the most poupular topics in human's life.  I might say everyone is in the pursuit of happines.  But what makes us feel happy? In this project, we use the natural langauge processing and text mining techniques to explore the patterns behind happy moments. What are type of words and sentences widely used in HappyDB? How emotional are the contents? What are major categories of happy moments? Is there any difference on the categories of happy moments between 24 hours period and 3-months period, female and male, married and not married,old and young?
